Comprehensive IPL Data Analysis with Apache Spark

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data engineering pipeline and analysis of IPL (Indian Premier League) cricket data using Apache Spark on Databricks, with data stored in Amazon S3. The focus of the project is to showcase how to build a data pipeline, transform raw data, and generate insights using Spark SQL for analytics and visualization.

Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:

	1.	Ingest IPL cricket data stored in Amazon S3 into Databricks.
	2.	Perform data transformation and cleansing using Apache Spark.
	3.	Analyze the cleaned dataset using Spark SQL to extract meaningful insights.
	4.	Visualize the results and generate reports for further decision-making.

Tools & Technologies

	•	Databricks: For data engineering and analytics.
	•	Apache Spark: Used for large-scale data processing and transformations.
	•	Amazon S3: Data storage location for IPL datasets.
	•	SQL: For querying and analysis.
	•	Visualization Tools: Databricks notebooks, which support built-in visualization.

Data Source

The IPL dataset used in this project is stored in Amazon S3, which consists of ball-by-ball match data, including information such as match ID, innings, teams, batting and bowling statistics, extras, and dismissals.

Pipeline Steps

1. Data Ingestion

	•	Source: IPL cricket data in CSV/Parquet format stored on Amazon S3.
	•	Target: Data is ingested into Databricks using Spark to read from S3.
	•	Tools: Amazon S3, Databricks, Apache Spark.

2. Data Transformation

	•	Process: Data cleansing and filtering, including removing invalid deliveries (e.g., wides, no-balls).
	•	Transformations: Using Spark SQL to handle missing values, standardize columns, and filter the data for valid deliveries.
	•	Output: Cleaned and processed data ready for analysis.

3. Analysis with Spark SQL

	•	Queries: Running SQL queries on the transformed data to:
	•	Calculate the top scorers.
	•	Analyze bowler performance.
	•	Determine match-winning strategies (e.g., key overs, best strike rates).
	•	Explore extra deliveries and their impact on match outcomes.

4. Visualization

	•	Visuals: Data is visualized within Databricks notebooks, utilizing Spark’s built-in visualization capabilities to create bar charts, line charts, and pie charts.
	•	Reports: Generated reports focus on player performances, team statistics, and match analytics.

Key Features

	•	Scalable Data Pipeline: Built using Apache Spark for efficient and scalable data processing.
	•	Storage: IPL data is stored in Amazon S3, ensuring flexible and reliable access.
	•	Analytics: SQL-based analytics for querying large datasets.
	•	Visualization: Quick and easy visualizations in Databricks notebooks to help explore insights interactively.

How to Run the Project

Prerequisites

	•	Databricks Account: Set up a Databricks workspace for running notebooks.
	•	Amazon S3 Access: Ensure you have access to the IPL dataset stored in an S3 bucket.

Steps

	1.	Clone this repository to your Databricks workspace.
	2.	Set up AWS credentials to access the S3 bucket containing IPL data.
	3.	Upload IPL data to Amazon S3 or point to an existing S3 bucket.
	4.	Run the Databricks notebook provided in the repository, which ingests the data from S3, performs transformations, and runs analysis queries.
	5.	View the results and visualizations within the notebook.

Future Improvements

	•	Add more advanced machine learning models for predictive analysis (e.g., predicting match outcomes).
	•	Integrate streaming data pipelines for live match analysis.
	•	Explore additional datasets (player stats, venue data) to enrich analysis.

Conclusion

This project showcases the powerful capabilities of Apache Spark and Databricks for large-scale data processing and analysis. By leveraging cloud storage with Amazon S3 and transforming data with Spark SQL, we have created a comprehensive IPL data analysis pipeline.
